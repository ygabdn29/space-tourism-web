## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project, I think I exercise lots of things I've learnt before and use them in a new way.

### Continued development

- The "Explore" button in home still missing the hover state. I still don't know how to implement it, maybe in the future where i revisit the project I will try to implement it.
- I think for the design to be really "responsive" to all common resolution is kinda hard to implement. So my solution still break at some resolution break-point. I think I need to improve this behavior in the future.
- I think there is still lots of room for improvement in general. When I have more knowledge I'll try to improve this project in areas I can.
